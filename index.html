    <h2 align="center"><b><i>The Mystery of 9 Unknown Man</i></b></h2>
    <br>
    <p align="left">The Nine Unknown Men of Ashoka significantly impacted social, political, economic, and scientific events.

        An underground room with men wearing hats discussing plans in code names, swirls of smoke, hidden chambers where a password is needed to enter—these are the images that flash upon our mind if we hear the term ‘secret societies.’ These societies have been a part of advanced civilizations through ages. The mist of mystery surrounding them can be linked to the very name though! While many secret organizations have existed, some have eventually came to light. Take  and you may be familiar with them Illuminati for example. This secret society was formed in Europe in 1776 by a Bavarian professor named Adam Weishaupt. Well, there are many more like this through history. Today, we will share the tale of one secret society created centuries back by none other than emperor Ashoka of the Maurya Empire who ruled India from 268 to 232 BC. It is known as The Nine Unknown Men formed around 273 BC. But who were these nine individuals? Does it still exist, as some believe? Is this society a myth or reality? Read on to find answers to these questions. </p>
        <h2><b>Inception of the society</b></h2>
        <p>Up until the Kalinga War, fought between Ashoka and an independent feudal kingdom located on the east coast around the 3rd century BC, the emperor was a ruthless ruler. After the Kalinga battle was won at the cost of over 1,00,000 lives, Ashoka turned to Buddhism and realized that knowledge is power. He felt that ancient India had immense knowledge and wisdom and it should be preserved. The knowledge can be used for great deeds but can also prove to be dreadful if it reached the wrong hands, he understood. So, he gathered nine of India's brightest brains of the time to form the secret club, The Nine Unknown Men.   </p>
        <h2><b>Myth or fact?</b> </h2>
        <p>It is difficult to imagine that an ancient society has continued to exist in secrecy for more than 2000 years, influencing global events from the deep jungles of India, with no infrastructure, technology, or equipment. So it's up to us to decide whether the current existence of the society is a myth or fact. </p>
